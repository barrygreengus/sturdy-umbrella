#Our Rust Neural Network Libary

##It will offer an interface to make and use:
* Feed forward NNs
* Sigmoid and Tau activation functions
* Variable learning parameters (learning rate, epoch size, etc)
* other stuff? 
* dumping out an NN as JSON?
* Recurrent Neural Networks?

We'll def use OOP: let's (roughly) plan out our object model
Implementing the math efficiently shouldn't be hard, but will take some thought.

We can always update our code as we learn more about rust, but if we want to get a
start, definitely look at rust impl (classes).
