 Trying to do fun things with Rust. Also, what's Rust

Tell me? do androids dream of electric sheep?
Also, maybe we could do something with scraping?
Maybe we can make a text adventure?
Maybe we can create a video game?

Maybe we can create a model -- something to predict if stocks go up?

something with google maps api, or twitter api??
