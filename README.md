 Trying to do fun things with Rust. Also, what's Rust

I suggest that we run all of code in a Linux VM just so we're running the same system.
Let's at least each stick with some flavor of Ubuntu (I tend to use Xubntu a lot)

Rust resources: (Feel free to add to this list)
* https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
* http://rustbyexample.com/

In general, I would like to follow (a few) best practices for software engineering
for the sake of our sanity.
Let's at a least:
* plan out our system before we create it (can be a rough plan)
* WRITE TESTS FOR OUR CODE (Rust has built-in support for unit tests :D)
