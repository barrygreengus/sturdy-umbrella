# Project Ideas

Graphs:
Determine degree of connections between twitter accounts (twitter API)
(What do you mean by degreee of connection?)

Text Adventure:
Maybe try and create a dungeon master for dungeons and dragons


Boring idea:
Make a library for stochastic gradient descent

SLightly less boring:
MAke a neural net library?
 - or make a neural net and use to do something cool. Like classify something interest.
 - take a look in r/databases, there's some fun shit there.

AI:
build an A/I for some game, maybe something odd, like settlers, or cards against humanity
 - A significant part of this would be building a representation of the game
 OH! we can make an AI to play a videogame
 - which will be hard, but cool. we can use things like VBA emulators
